<font face="arial" size="4"><b>Kid Radd Frequently Asked Questions</b></font>
<font face="arial" size="2">
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Is this a sprite comic? / Where can I get a ROM of Kid Radd? / Where are these sprites from?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> All the Kid Radd characters were created by me, <a href="mailto:danno@kidradd.com">Dan Miller,</a> and crudely drawn/animated by Paint Shop Pro.  So no, there was never a Kid Radd game on the NES or any other console, and this isn't really a sprite comic.  Still, once in a great while you'll see a cameo sprite, like the power-ups being eaten in Itty Bitty's diner.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Why would you want to create a "fake" sprite comic?  Aren't you gonna scare away everyone who thinks sprite comics are crappy?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> I dunno, maybe I'm a masochist.  Seriously, I recognize that for the handful of decent and funny sprite comics out there, there are hundreds of crappy imitators, and that's given the artform a bad reputation.  But I <i>like</i> the artform, even though I don't like using other people's creations.  So I made a comic using my own characters, so they could be exactly who I wanted them to be without having to fit into established characters (i.e. Sonic's a snob, Mario's an idiot, Crash Bandicoot's my father and so on).
<br><br>
Plus, I could eventually sell merchandise without violating copyrights. (Insert capitalist pig laughter)
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Why won't this comic work in Netscape?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> It's complicated, but the two main reasons are 1) The javascript that "starts" certain animations won't work in Netscape, and 2) Netscape won't allow animated backgrounds in table cells.  There's probably a way to fix the first problem, but nothing I can do about the second one until Netscape allows animated backgrounds.  So for now I've given up and just asked people to use Explorer, since it's used ten times more often than Netscape anyways.  Hope you appreciate the plug, Mr. Gates.
<br><br>Edit:  Apparently more recent versions of Netscape handle the comic just fine.  Hooray!
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Who are you, anyway?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> I'm a twenty-six year old geek who lives in Cleveland and works as a manager at an ice cream shop.  I used to like programming BASIC games on the Apple IIe, but in recent years playing around with HTML has become my hobby.  Thus, this comic is my current (and hopefully longterm) hobby. 
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Are these questions really frequently asked?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> So far they've all been asked of me, some more often than others.  But from here on I'll probably just think up other questions people might wonder about, and answer them myself.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Isn't that kind of schizophrenic of you?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Yes.  Bacon.  What?
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Now you're mocking yourself with your own questions.  Why?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Like I said, I'm a masochist.  Um, we/I had better get back to some real questions.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Will there ever be any real Kid Radd games?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Hopefully.  I've already made one Atari-ish game called <a href="http://home.att.net/~clowcards/bogeygame/files/intro.htm" target="_top">Bogey Bomber,</a> and may make others if I can improve my javascript skills.  My younger brother Dave (you might know him as forum mod clowcards) would also like to create something, and a couple of other fans have also said they might make games.  But it's too early to name any "release" dates.  If/When any of this happens, I'll put up Games and Fanart sections for them.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> How does your comic's viewer-thingy work?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> It's simpler than it looks, but tough to explain.  Every page has five or six panels, each consisting of an identical table that looks like a "viewer.".  The "next" and "previous" buttons are really internal links that take you to another panel on the page.  Because all the viewers look the same, when you jump between the panels on the page, it looks like there's only one viewer and gives the illusion that the viewer's "screen" is all that changes.
<br><br>
Eventually I'll put up a much more thorough explanation of it all, titling it "The Making of Kid Radd" or something equally self-congratulatory.  Edit:  <a href="making1.htm" target="_top">It's up.</a>  Anyways, good question.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Don't compliment yourself.</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> That wasn't a question.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Fine, then:  Would you like a knuckle sandwich?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Hey now, you're me.  We can't be hitting ourselves.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Wanna bet?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Ow! Hey!  Stop that!
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Had enough yet?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Alright, alright, uncle!  Geez, I think I need a therapist.  Are there any more real questions?
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Will there be any Radd posters, t-shirts, that kind of stuff anytime soon?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Probably, but I think I'll wait 'til at least January so I don't have to report any sales on this year's tax returns.  If the oft-quoted statistic that 1% of your readers will want to buy stuff is true, then there's about a dozen people who want Radd merchandise at the time I write this.  So I'm not in too much of a hurry.  Edit:  <a href="store.htm" target="_top">The usual cafepress stuff</a> is now available; other stuff may be on the way.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Thanks for reading this FAQ, and we'll add future questions if necessary.</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Hey, the Q can't have the last word!  Every Q has to have an A.  That's how it works!
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> Have you ever been in traction?</b>
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">A:</font></b> Never mind.
<br><br>
<b><font color="0000ff">Q:</font> If you have any questions not covered here, drop me/us some <a href="mailto:danno@kidradd.com">mail.</a> Have a great day!</b>
